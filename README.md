# Replit Solidity Template
Welcome to the world of Ethereum and Web3! This is a beta template for Solidity development on Replit. Solidity is the language used to create Smart Contracts, which are programs that run on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Replit 
- create an account on the replit and upload the file on the replit.
- install the package and dependencies: `npm i`

Features include:
- Hot reloading
- Solidity error checking
- Deploying multiple contracts
- UI for testing out contracts
- Replit testnet + faucet

## Getting started
**Just press the `Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è` button!**

- You should only need to do this once (and might take like 15s). This will install all relevant packages, start up the contract deployment UI, and compile your `contract.sol` file.

- `contract.sol` will automatically recompile whenever you edit it, and all your contracts inside of this file will be available to deploy from the UI.

- Pressing `cmd-s` or `ctrl-s` (windows) will reload the UI.

We have preinstalled packages from `@openzeppelin/contracts`. To install other solidity packages that are distributed on npm, make sure you install them using the Package Installer üì¶ in the sidebar

## Examples

We included a few example contracts in the `examples` folder. These will not be automatically deployed or accessible in the UI, but you can copy / paste them into your main `contract.sol` file or import them. They're there for your reference!
